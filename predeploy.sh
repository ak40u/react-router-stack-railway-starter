# from the template, so the first migration can arrive before the database has
# started accepting connections. Railway does not retry a failed pre-deploy
# command - the deployment stops there and is reported as failed - so an
# unreachable database is waited out here.
#
# Only P1001 ("Can't reach database server") is retried. A migration that fails
# on its own contents is fatal on the first attempt: repeating it would delay the
# error without changing it.
